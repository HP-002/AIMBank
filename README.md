# AIMBank

# AIMBank is a Java program consisting of 2 classes. It uses the concept of Linked Lists to manage different accounts within the bank.

# class account stores the details of each account within it which includes the customer's name, email, phone number, account number, and balance. It even holds the address for the next and previous accounts.

# class AIMBank has all the functions such as openAcc(), closeAcc(), viewDetails(), deposit(), withdraw(), printMenu(), help() and aboutUs(). It has the main class which is executed. It is a menu-driven program that runs till the customer terminates the sequence. 

# Future Upgrades:
# 1) The program will use file handling to store the data of all the current accounts in an encrypted file when the program terminates so that when it is run again, all the data can be read again. This way the data is never lost.
# 2) The program will be integrated into a mobile app with a user-friendly interface.
